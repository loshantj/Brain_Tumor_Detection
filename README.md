Project Description
This project aims to develop a Deep Neural Network (DNN) for the early detection of brain tumors in interstellar travelers using MRI scans. Brain tumors can be slow-growing and difficult to detect initially, but as they progress, they can lead to symptoms like memory loss, hallucinations, and motor function impairment. Detecting these tumors at an early stage is critical for timely intervention and treatment.

Dataset
We have a dataset of over 3,000 MRI images obtained from interstellar travelers, which are categorized into four folders. These folders likely represent different classes or types of brain tumors, and our goal is to build a model that can accurately classify these images into their respective categories.

Model Architecture
In this project, we use the Inception V3 model as the basis for our Deep Neural Network. Inception V3 is a powerful convolutional neural network architecture that has proven effective in image classification tasks. We will fine-tune this pre-trained model on our dataset to leverage its feature extraction capabilities and adapt it to our specific task.

Detection and Treatment
Early detection of brain tumors is essential for interstellar travelers, as these tumors can lead to severe cognitive and motor impairments. Once the model identifies a potential tumor in an MRI scan, we can initiate medical interventions such as surgery and targeted radiation therapy, which have demonstrated high effectiveness in halting tumor growth.
